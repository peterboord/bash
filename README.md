# bash
Useful bash functions.
Some functions use commands from the FMRIB-FSL suite of imaging tools and are specific to neuroimaging.
Other functions allow manipulation of 2D arrays/tables in bash.

Include the line 'source path_to_functions_file/functions' in your .bashrc file to allow execution of the functions on the command line or in scripts.
